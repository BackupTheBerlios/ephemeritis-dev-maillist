Subject: [Ephemeritis-dev] 0.4.3 released
Message-ID: <45d38ec30511290122s7bd9aed1g@mail.gmail.com>

Just for the record, I've released 0.4.3 to get things going.  Here
are some badly formatted notes.

Hooray.
Mike.


Initial release of Ephemeritis
==============================

Release Notes

This is the initial release of Ephemeritis, which is by no means complete.
Lots of credit needs to go to William McClain, who wrote Astrolabe upon
which Ephemeritis is based.  Credit should also go to Jean Meeus, of course,
who compiled or designed, and published most of the algorithims upon which
Ephemeritis (and Astrolabe) have been based.

Compilation and installation follows the same pattern as most GNU Autotools
packages:

./configure
make
make install

'make doxygen-doc' should generate the doxygen API documentation from the
code in the doxygen-doc/html/ directory.

You may need to pass various parameters to the configure script depending on
your setup.  Try './configure --help' if you'd like to see what's available.

Ephemeritis isn't ready to be used at the moment, unless you know a little
about what you're doing.  The API is nowhere near stable, and much of the
code and algorithms aren't properly tested.  If you're interested in helping
as a developer or otherwise, please let me know.  It would be especially
helpful to have someone who has experience in ephemeris calculations,
because I'm learning a lot of this as I go, but any enthusiastic assistance
would be appreciated.

Join the dev mailing list if you'd like to be involved or kept up to date in
any way.

Initial release of Ephemeritis
==============================

Changes Log

* Renamed code references from Astrolabe to Ephemeritis.
* Re-packaged using GNU Autotools.
* Ported C++ code to C code.
* Moved external astrolabe configuration file variables to internal function
parameters.
* Incorporated VSOP table data inside compiled code, instead of the separate
text file.  I'm not sure what the best way is to deal with it at this point,
but I personally prefer it being compiled for now.
* Removed Astrolabe example programs (except for validate_meeus, to use for
unit testing).
* Added precession code.
* Added atmospheric refraction code.
* Updated documentation in Doxygen format.
* Many other adjustments and additions.
